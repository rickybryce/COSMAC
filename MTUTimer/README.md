<h1>COSMAC 1802 Timer for Microprocessor Training Unit</h1>
<p>This is simply a stop watch program for the COSMAC 1802.  I used the a18 assembler to develop the Intel Hex file.</p>
<p>The total seconds will also display on the LEDs.</p>
<p>Please remember to use line and character delays.  I used 10ms for the Character Delay, and 100ms for the Line Delay, 
  although you could probably get by with much shorter delay settings.</p>
