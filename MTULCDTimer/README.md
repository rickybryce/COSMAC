<h1>COSMAC Microprocessor Training Unit LCD Timer</h1>
<p>This stop watch program is for the CDP 1802 Microprocessor Training Unit for use with a 16x2 LCD Display.</p>
<p>EF1 will start and pause the timer. EF2 resets the timer. </p>
<p>I compiled this program with the a18 assembler, You can calibrate the time in the delay loops.</p>
<p>Don't forget to add your character and line delays before sending the file to the training unit.  I used 10ms/100ms, but you can probably get by with much less of a delay.</p>
<p>This program does not require any user input at this time.</p>
